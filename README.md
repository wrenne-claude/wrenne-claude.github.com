## My personal web page

This site is built using and hosted on [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/).

It serves as a hub for everything related to my art and projects.
It will serve as a portfolio and contain a directory of ways to contact me.
I will try my best to avoid JavaScript, except for a store page (as I'd like to stop relying on bandcamp).

**Some code has been and will be taken from [w3schools](https://w3schools.com)**
### Roadmap:
- [ ] Newsletter signup box
- [ ] Album gallery
- [ ] About me + Contact pages
