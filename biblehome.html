                    If you're reading this, you know something's up. You realised that Zuck and Elon
                    may not be as trustworthy as they seem to be, and that the internet is an overall
                    unsafe place, full of harmful ads and trackers. It's okay to be paranoid about this
                    kind of stuff. Nobody wants to be spied on and have their information sold to a data
                    broker or the Chinese Communist Party. You want privacy, you want to know what's
                    happening to your personal data and where it goes. Now, we're not talking about
                    being anonymous here, that's too difficult, perhaps impossible. We're talking about
                    being free from the clutches of Google, Amazon and other malicious entities that
                    materialise us.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I once read TikTok's entire privacy policy to analyse it, in order to show my friends,
                    who at the time were frequent users of the Chinese spyware, that there's more stuff
                    happening behind the scenes that they know about. Typing rhythm and patterns were among
                    many things that shocked them, and subsequently helped them quit the app altogether.
                <p>
                    If you think about it, online privacy is strongly tied to our mental health.
                    By caring about staying low-key and keeping exposure to such addicting services like
                    TikTok or Instagram to a minimum, we're able to stay sane. It's because social media,
                    and many other parts of the internet, have become traps, psychological weaponry that
                    is constantly deployed and ready to fire. I still find myself scrolling mindlessly on
                    various sites, obviously, it happens. But all the major social media apps and websites
                    are exploiting this to the fullest. Tired of scrolling through your normal instagram
                    feed? Have some reels! Tired of reels? Check your explore page out! Tired of that, too?
                    Hop on facebook! Etc. etc....
                </p>
                <p>
                    Just like our attention spans, our dopamine levels are equally messed up, which makes it
                    more and more difficult to take the correct pill and change your internet browsing lifestyle.
                    Who would want to go these extra miles just so Xi Jinping doesn't know exactly where they live?<br>
                    Like with any addiction, you have to gradually put away what you're using. Don't do it
                    cold-turkey, let your mind do this peacefully.<br>
                </p>
                <p>
                    With all that stuff out of the way, let me guide you through the wonderful world of
                    online privacy.

                <p>
                    I'd like to thank Richard Stallman, saint of the Church of Emacs, my idol and inspiration.<br>
                    Without this man we wouldn't have GNU/Linux, the FSF, and many tools and free software we use every single day.<br>
                    I'm specifically thanking him for his beloved character and attitude, as well as his unparalleled dedication to the libre movement.<br>
                    I really recommend reading Stallman's <a href="https://www.gnu.org/doc/fsfs3-hardcover.pdf"><i>Free Software, Free Society</i></a>, as it contains a lot of interesting information alongside the basics.<br>

                <p>
                    I would also like to thank Kenny, the <a href="https://odysee.com/@AlphaNerd:8">Mental Outlaw</a>.<br>
                    His videos are very informative, wether they regard linux, OpSec or cooking!<br>
                    He has an entire series of videos dedicated to the topic of online privacy.<br>

                    According to Wikipedia, privacy is the ability to seclude information about oneself.

                    HTML elements can be broadly categorized into one of two
