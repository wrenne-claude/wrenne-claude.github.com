                        If you're reading this, you know something's up. You realised that Zuck and Elon
                        may not be as trustworthy as they seem to be, and that the internet is an overall
                        unsafe place, full of harmful ads and trackers. It's okay to be paranoid about this
                        kind of stuff. Nobody wants to be spied on and have their information sold to a data
                        broker or the Chinese Communist Party. You want privacy, you want to know what's
                        happening to your personal data and where it goes. Now, we're not talking about
                        being anonymous here, that's too difficult, perhaps impossible. We're talking about
                        being free from the clutches of Google, Amazon and other malicious entities that
                        materialise us.

                        Do you also have your favourite password, that you use every single time when you
                        register accounts on websites? Well, say your goodbyes because you're never seeing
                        it again. Reusing passwords is one of the worst habits you can have. For some, it
                        might be very difficult to move on from it. Fortunately, there's a very useful tool
                        that allows users to quickly Ctrl+C and Ctrl+V their passwords and let them sit
                        stored securly and locally. Because you don't want your passwords, and thus all
                        your personal data, to sit on a big company's server, that is a main target for
                        cybercriminals.
