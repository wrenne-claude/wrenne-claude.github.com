                Translation from a facebook post that I wrote in polish:
            </p>
            <p class="albumdesc">
                This [album] consists of 6 tracks, of which 2 have already been available on streaming services. All of these tracks are really important to me, and I'm proud of how they turned out. I hope that you also like them.
            </p>
            <p class="albumdesc">
                I really stepped out of my beloved comfort zone in this one. Finally, the vocals are in the front of the mix, and not <i>every</i> track needs to have noisy, shoegazy guitars.
            </p>
            <p class="albumdesc">
                Out of all the songs I think <i>Slow Burn</i> is the one that I'm the proudest of. It's the one I've spent the most time on (maybe aside from <i>Glow</i>, which sat out its fair share in the "rejects" folder). 
                The "slow" trilogy makes up a coherent whole. <i>Slow Down</i> is this post-rockish experiment, <i>Slow Motion</i> is a rugged example of the sonic path I'm on, while <i>Slow Burn</i> is my life anthem in a slowcore style (while 
                also being the most structurally diverse track in my discography), which I was able to compose thanks to tuning my guitar's g string half-step down. I recommend experimenting with different tunings, you never know what's gonna happen. 
            </p>
            <p class="albumdesc">
                <i>Tell them I said "Hi"</i> is an ambient track based on one looped chord. It's not like it's some greatly thought out, intellectual ambient music, but it's still a stricte audio way of expressing emotions. 
                I won't be writing much about <i>Scars</i>, as the lyrics are pretty straightforward and aren't hidden under a shoegazy wall of sound.
            </p>
            <p class="albumdesc">
                Now <i>Glow</i> on the other hand is, in my humble opinion, the best thing I could have squeezed out of me. I'm so proud of it. It's also pretty important for me due to how I worked on it and its lyrics. 
                I received a lot of compliments regarding <i>Glow</i> since I've released it and I think about them often. It is also thanks to them that I consider the song to be so important to me.
