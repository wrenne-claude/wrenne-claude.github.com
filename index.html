        <center><pre>Hello, reader. I'm Wrenne Claude, a musician by profession and a paranoid freak by hobby.
        I'm writing this bible with myself and my close ones in mind. I'm not an expert on these matters by ANY means,
        but I am passionate about online privacy and security. There are many, many use cases for this "bible".
        Of course, you can follow any tips or guides you want and ignore anything you consider overkill for your use case.
        A person who doesn't want Meta, Bezos or Musk spying on them will take less precautions than a drug dealer.
        Obviously.

        I hope you enjoy what follows. I'll be modifying this site accordingly, not everything will be up right away.</pre></center>
