        <center><p>Hello, reader. I'm Wrenne Claude, a musician by profession and a paranoid freak by hobby.<br>
This is my personal site. It will contain a lot of my work, mostly written (as I host my music <a href="https://wrenneclaude.bandcamp.com/">elsewhere</a>)<br>
This is also the place where you'll find the <a href="biblehome.html">Private Internet Usage Bible's 2024 (first) edition</a>. It's my own spin on an online privacy guide.<br>
I don't think PIUB24E will ever be finished, as with more experience and knowledge gained I will update it accordingly.<br>
I'm also thinking about starting a blog here, but I'm not sure. Maybe I should add a roadmap.<br>

I hope you enjoy what follows. I'll try to update this site regularly.</p></center>

            <h2>
                Some info about me
            </h2>
            <p>
                I live in Poland, I play the guitar in the noise rock / post-punk / no-wave revival band <a href="https://batcaveproductions.bandcamp.com/album/allarme">Allarme</a><br>
                I used to play in the deathrock groups <a href="https://eatmyteeth.bandcamp.com/track/core-rotten-to-its-core">Eat My Teeth</a> and Marie Laveau.<br>
                I also have a <a href="https://wrenneclaude.bandcamp.com">solo music project</a> that is a mix of shoegaze and slowcore, some of my favourite genres.<br>
                I also play the piano and have some basic knowledge about most western string and percussion instruments.<br>
                I've been daily driving GNU/Linux for around 2 years now, I think. I advocate for the Free/Libre and Open Source movements.<br>
                My favourite GNU/Linux distros are Gentoo and Nobara, and I proudly stay away from Manjaro. <a href="https://manjarno.pages.dev/">Here's why you should, too</a>.<br>
                I don't recommend Windows or Mac OS to anybody. I'm against non-free software that's also blatant spyware.<br>
                I'm fascinated by astronomy, I enjoy reading Hawking's works that target the general public.<br>
                My favourite bands of all time are Duster, Unwound, Sprain and Swans.<br>
                I'm fluent in Polish, English and French, I'm currently learning Japanese. I'd love to learn Hebrew, Thai, Arabic, Russian and German one day.<br>

            <h2>
                Let's get political
            </h2>
            <p>
                I'm generally aware of my political views, although I'm pretty uneducated in this field.<br>
                I've had my Marxist phase, I've read the manifesto and <i>The Capital</i>, and consider Marx to be a below-average writer.<br>
                For some time I associated with the anarcho-syndicalist movement, but realised that adding anything to anarchism kinda<br>
                defeats its purpose. Currently I consider myself an anarchist at the core, but achieving true and peaceful anarchy is<br>
                going to take some time, and I know I won't see it during my lifetime. That's why I support whatever leftist parties<br>
                I agree with in my country. Due to my slight political illiteracy I decided to take some online tests to define my views.<br>
                Even though I'm <i>still</i> trying to describe myself politically, maybe you'll understand these charts better:
            </p>
            <p>
                First up is the <a href="https://8values.github.io/">8values</a> test:<br>

            </p><br>
            <p>
                Afterwards I took the <a href="https://gouvernathor.github.io/">PolitiScales</a> test:<br>
                <img src="politiscales.png" style="width:25%;height:auto;">
