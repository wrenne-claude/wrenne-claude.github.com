        <center><p>Hello, reader. I'm Wrenne Claude, a musician by profession and a paranoid freak by hobby.<br>
I'm writing this bible with myself and my close ones in mind. I'm not an expert on these matters by ANY means,<br>
but I am passionate about online privacy and security. There are many, many use cases for this "bible".<br>
Of course, you can follow any tips or guides you want and ignore anything you consider overkill for your use case.<br>
A person who doesn't want Meta, Bezos or Musk spying on them will take less precautions than a drug dealer.<br>
Obviously.<br>

I hope you enjoy what follows. I'll be modifying this site accordingly, not everything will be up right away.</p></center>
